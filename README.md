#HillCipher
A hillcipher is an encryption tactic that uses matrix multiplication - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_cipher
I made this in my Security in Computing class. I added sample input files for the program to run properly. The sample files contains one file that is the key and one file that is the text to be encrypted.

After running "javac hillcipher.java" to compile the code, you can run the program like so:

java hillcipher inkey1.txt infile1.txt
